This is the flutter version of the Qhala android technical interview challenge :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: That I saw somewhere.

## Android Technologies
- Navigation – To manage your application navigation.
- Dagger - Hilt - Used to provide dependency injection.
- Retrofit 2 - OkHttp3 - Request/response API.
- Room – To save data if in offline mode.
- Glide - For image loading.
- Coroutines - reactive programming paradigm.
- LiveData - To see UI updates with data changes.
- Data Binding - bind UI components in layouts to data sources.

But since this is Flutter here is my chosen Technologies:
- Navigation - New Flutter 2.0 Navigation
- Dio - Request/response API
- Moor - To save data if in offline mode.
- CachedNetworkImage - For image Loading
- Flutter_cubit - For state management (UI updates with data changes && bind UI components in layouts to data sources.)

## Test
1. UI Tests
2. Repositories Test
3. Cubit Tests

## Design wireframe

## Todo
1. ~Setup project file structure~
2. Implement the UI mock up
3. Add the HTTP layer
4. Offline storage with moor
5. Add Tests
6. Setup CI/CD
